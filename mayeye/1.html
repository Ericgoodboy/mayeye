<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   MMRGlobal, Inc.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although the Company's primary business remains the offering of its MyMedicalRecords.com Personal Health Record and MMRPro professional document imaging and scanning solutions, the value of our intellectual property is growing,&quot; said Robert H. Lorsch, MMRGlobal Chairman and CEO. &quot;Clearly, as we move into the future, we will seek opportunities to leverage our intellectual property and enter into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">agreements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with strategic partners in patient care and other similar lines of business as well as with companies that specialize in maximizing the value of IP, such as Acacia Research or RPX Corporation and others who have successfully leveraged the values of intellectual property into billions of dollars of valuation for shareholders.&quot; </SPAN></P>
